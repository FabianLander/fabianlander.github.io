This post contains my notes from our reading seminar at MPI MiS, where we are exploring Riemann surfaces and sheaf theory with the goal of proving the Riemann-Roch theorem. Our primary reference is:

- Robert C. Gunning, *Lectures on Riemann Surfaces* (1973)

<!-- ### Definitions and Examples

Let $X$ be in the category of topological spaces and $\mathcal{C}$ the category of open sets on $X$, where the objects are open sets $\mathcal{U} \subset X$ and the morphisms are the inclusion maps $\iota : \mathcal{U} \rightarrow \mathcal{V}$.

A *presheaf* $\mahtcal{F}$ on $X$ is a functor from $\mathcal{C}$ to a category $\mathcal{S}$ like sets, abelian groups, rings, or $R$-moduls. We will consider abelian groups. ... -->
